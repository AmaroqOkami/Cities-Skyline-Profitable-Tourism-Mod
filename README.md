## Cities-Skyline-Profitable-Tourism-Mod

This mod helps you earn more from tourism.

The tourism income is increased in 10 times. Can be set from x2 to x100 in the game options.
The value 10 was choosen so that the income from tourism was roughly the same as the unique buildings upkeep.

And, as a bonus feature, the taxi income is doubled.  
Can be set from x1 (no change) to x10 in the game options.

Have fun!

**Question 1.** Why increase tourism income?  
**Answer.** Because tourism is highly unprofitable in vanilla. There are a lot of complaints on the web about this subject.

**Question 2.** Why not increase the number of tourists istead of the tourism income?  
**Answer.** The main reason is that it is much more complicated task and beyond of my capabilities. :(  

**Question 3.** Money is not an issue when my city grows big enough. What sense in increasing the income even more?  
**Answer.** Yes, in vanilla the unique buildings, which are the main  source of tourism, are a kind of bueatification rather than a source of income.  
Try to use a mod that makes the economy harder (for example, Difficulty Tuning mod). Together with the increased income from tourism, it can give you a new level of experience.
