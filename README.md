## Cities-Skyline-Profitable-Tourism-Mod

This mod helps you earn more from tourism.

By default, the tourism income is increased in 10 times. The value can be changed in the game options.

**Question 1.** Why increase tourism income?

Because tourism is highly unprofitable in vanilla. There are a lot of complaints on the web about this subject.

**Question 2.** Why not increase the number of tourists istead of tourism income?

I thought about that.

The main reason is that increasing number of tourists is much more complicated task (if possible). Doing this may also cause incompatibility with a number of other mods.

The second reason is the game limits on the number of units.

And finally, the number of tourists is not so low as you may think. Many people reported, and I can confirm this, that with a proper city planning the number of tourists can be up to 1000/week. It is about 4000/month or 50000/year! Not too much, but not a few though.

**Question 3.** Money is not an issue when my city grows big enough. Increasing the income even more is senseless. No?

I beleave, that's why tourism was made unprofitable. In vanilla, it is a kind of bueatification rather than a source of income.

Try to use a mod that makes the economy harder (for example, Difficulty Tuning mod). Together with the increased income from tourism, it can give you a new level of experience.
